## Summary of the Global Circulation Model Selection

#### `r Sys.Date()`

## Goal

Determine the four most centrally located global circulation model (GCM) across four [Shared Socio-economic Pathways](https://www.carbonbrief.org/cmip6-the-next-generation-of-climate-models-explained) (SSPs)(126, 245, 370 and 585) at the 2081-2100 time stamp. The four most common centrally located GCM will be used in as the inputs for the larger project.

### Parameters

Models were evaluated using a local deployment of the GCM compareR shiny application.

1.  CMIP version: CMIP6

2.  Climate Change Scenario:

    1.  year: 2081-2100 - this year was choose as it will represent the largest amount of divergence between the models.

    2.  Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP): This is a measure of emission intensity, all four options were evaluated.

3.  General Circulation Models: all available models were considered

4.  Type of Comparison

    1.  Bio1 - Annual Mean Temperature

    2.  Bio2 - Annual Precipitation

5.  Define analysis area

    1.  created a generous retangle of CONUS

    2.  xmin : -125.5812, xmax : -69.46746, ymin : 23.85369, ymax : 47.87214

```

## Difference method

The following steps were used to generate a single measure for evaluation.

1.  Difference from mean.

-   absolute value of x - Mean of range of values
-   applied to temperate and precipitation

2.  Normal the difference from mean

-   Value = {(x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x))} ; where x is a vector of all temperature or precipitation values

3.  Combine the noralized values

-   value = normalize temperature + normalized precipitation

The result is a single value that weight temperature and precipitation evenly.

## Summary

By combining the individual evaluations at each Shared Socioeconomic Pathway we are able to evaluate which GCMs are nearest to the average across all ssp pathways.

```{r}
datatable(df)
```

The top for models

**CNRM.ESM2.1** **MIROC6** **MIROC.ES2L** **CNRM.CM6.1**

Are the current suggestion for use as the ensemble dataset for creating a generalized prediction of the future maximim temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation at varies NPGS sites.
